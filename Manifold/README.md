# Manifolds

These are the code I've used to generate the figures for my lab meeting presentation about non-linearity in manifolds.

I didn't really referenced any paper for this presentation, but you'll find this paper interesting.

```

## Requirements

I run the following python on jupyter notebook.

```text
python==3.11.10
jupyter==1.1.1
jupyter_core==5.7.2
jupyter_client==8.6.3
ipython==8.27.0
ipykernel==6.29.5
```

And the following packages are required:

```text
numpy==2.0.2
pandas==2.2.3
matplotlib==3.9.2
seaborn==0.13.2
scikit-learn==1.5.2
torch==2.4.1
tqdm==4.66.5
```

I'm running CUDA 12.1, but cpu should be fine.

## Usage

Enjoy!
